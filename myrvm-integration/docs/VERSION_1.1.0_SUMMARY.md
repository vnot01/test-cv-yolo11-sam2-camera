# Version 1.1.0 - Summary of Changes

**Project:** MyRVM Platform Integration with Jetson Orin Nano  
**Release Date:** September 18, 2025  
**Version:** 1.1.0  

## 🎯 Release Overview

Version 1.1.0 focuses on fixing test script field validation issues and improving the success rate of processing engine registration. This release addresses critical validation errors that were preventing the Jetson Orin from successfully registering as a processing engine with the MyRVM Platform.

## 🔧 Key Changes

### **1. Test Script Field Validation Fixes**

**Primary File Modified:** `debug/test_full_integration.py`

**Problem Solved:**
- Processing engine registration was failing with 422 validation errors
- Test script was using incorrect field names and data types
- Advanced workflow test success rate was 0%

**Solution Implemented:**
- Updated all field names to match server-side validation requirements
- Fixed data types (integers, booleans, strings)
- Removed invalid fields that don't exist in ProcessingEngine model
- Added all required fields for successful registration

### **2. Field Mapping Corrections**

| Field | Old Value | New Value | Change Type |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `type` | `'edge_vision'` | `'nvidia_cuda'` | Value Change |
| `gpu_memory_limit` | `'8GB'` | `8` | Type Change |
| `server_address` | ❌ Missing | `'172.28.93.97'` | Added |
| `port` | ❌ Missing | `5000` | Added |
| `docker_gpu_passthrough` | ❌ Missing | `True` | Added |
| `model_path` | ❌ Missing | `'/models/yolo11n.pt'` | Added |
| `processing_timeout` | ❌ Missing | `30` | Added |
| `auto_failover` | ❌ Missing | `True` | Added |
| `is_active` | ❌ Missing | `True` | Added |

### **3. Test Results Improvement**

| Metric | Version 1.0.0 | Version 1.1.0 | Improvement |
|--------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| Processing Engine Registration | ❌ 422 Error | ✅ 201 Created | 100% Success |
| Engine ID Generated | ❌ None | ✅ ID: 28 | Success |
| Advanced Workflow Tests | 0/5 (0%) | 1/5 (20%) | +20% |
| Overall Test Success Rate | 6/11 (55%) | 7/11 (64%) | +9% |

## 📊 Impact Assessment

### **✅ Positive Impacts**

1. **Processing Engine Registration:** Now fully functional
2. **Test Coverage:** Improved from 0% to 20% for advanced workflow
3. **Field Validation:** All fields now match server-side requirements
4. **Data Types:** Proper types used throughout
5. **Production Readiness:** Core functionality operational

### **⏳ Remaining Issues**

1. **Database Schema:** Server-side migration still needed for advanced features
2. **Processing History:** Endpoint not implemented (404 error)
3. **RVM Status:** Database relationship issues remain
